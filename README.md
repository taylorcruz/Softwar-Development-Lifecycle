How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?
  I interpret user needs by discussing their desires for the product prior to starting the development process.  I implement them into a program by creating user stories to give the development team in depth detail on what the customer wants and what the requirements are.  User stories help with this by giving the team the detail they need to give the user the product they wanted.
  
How do I approach developing programs?  What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
    I approach developing programs by reading the user stories.  I would like to use a kanban board to keep in contact with the team so that we are all aware of what has been completed, what is being worked on, and what still needs to be worked on.
    
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
     To be a good team member means to have good communication with the team.  A good team member will keep the team updated on what is going on with their task and ask for help when necessary.
